# Electricity Consumption Feedback Program (ECFP)

## Introduction
Welcome, this is a repository for an electricity consumption calculator program that I created for my 12th grade capstone research project that aims to help solve the problem of increasing electricity bills in the Philippines. The research started around January of 2022 and ended on April of 2022. The program was meant to act as a prototype that can help solve the problem the research was focused on. It is a program built using the C++ programming language. The program only runs on the terminal and the source code mostly uses beginner-level C++ code. This program was the second C++ program I created and was also the second program I created ever since I started to learn how to code.

## Repository Content Description
In case you are unfamiliar with the files in this repository, here is a run down of each one:
- **bin folder** - It contains the release (stable) and debug (unstable) versions of the program. Both the debug and release folder contain the two dependencies needed to run the .exe file. This means that you can run the program no matter the folder you choose to download and use
- **obj folder** - It contains the release (stable) and debug (unstable) object files of the program. These files were created by the compiler and were linked to the source file to create the .exe file.
- **.gitignore** - Contains a list of all ignored files in the version control system
- **Prototype_Elec_Cons_Calc.cbp** - CodeBlocks project file
- **Prototype_Elec_Cons_Calc.layout** - CodeBlocks layout file or file that saves the last position you were in when you use the project file
- **README.md** - Is the file that contains what you are reading right now
- **main.cpp** - The C++ source code file

## How To Edit The Project
To edit the project, you first need to download CodeBlocks and then clone the repository into your local device. You can start editing by opening the Prototype_Elec_Cons_Calc.cbp file.

## How To Use The Program
To use the program, simply open the bin folder and download the Release (stable version) or Debug (unstable version) folder. Both of them should contain the .exe file needed to run the program as well a the two dependencies needed for the program to run.

## Acknowledgement
This project was created with the help of my research groupmates who assisted in testing the program and in providing feedback for the improvement of the program or project. One of them is SmokeyBlaze, and the other 4 people did not wish to have their names be publicized here.
